This mod contains shared code for some Forge and Fabric mods.

Therefore, it doesn't add new features and won't change the user experience, but some mods depend on it.

## Legal note

This mod is based on [Architectury API](https://github.com/architectury/architectury-api/tree/1.19.2)Â and therefore uses some scripts from it.
